# language-translation
A neural network to translate from one language to another.<br />
In this project, I'll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English to 
French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.<br />
The dataset used is a small portion of [WMT10 French-English corpus](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/translation-task.html).<br />
This project is done as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course of Udacity.
